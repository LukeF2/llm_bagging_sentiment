Here is a sample usage of this tool:

```
api_key = "your_api_key_here"

model_variants = [
    ("groq/mixtral-8x7b-32768", "Be concise."),
    ("openai/gpt-3.5-turbo", "Respond clearly and concisely."),
    ("mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct", "Respond accurately."),
    # You can reuse the same model with different prompt styles, or different models entirely
]

text_input = "I absolutely loved the new Spider-Man movie!"
ensemble_prediction = bagged_sentiment_classify(text_input, api_key, model_variants)
print(f"Bagged Sentiment: {ensemble_prediction}")
```
